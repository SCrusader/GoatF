Project Proposal 
Project name: GoatF (Greatest of All Time Finder) (tentative)
 
Purpose: To allow users to form/create groups in the interest of finding locals to do activities of similar interests. How the users utilize the groups is entirely up to them. Example: setting meetups, finding others to play games (online or outside), etc. 
 
Implementations: sign ups, group/voice chat, location/weather api (possible recommendations for locations), user personalizations, emojis(?) 
 
How is this problem solved currently (if at all)?
Currently, there are several different platforms that accomplishes our goal indirectly. Facebook allows users to form groups and look up other different groups of interests but there is a label of being a stranger that separates users from one another. Our goal is to go one step further and try to break down this barrier by allowing users to have all these functions in one place.
 
How will this project make life easier?
With the help of GoatF, planning excursions, or events, is made simple. You can browse the directory to find hikes, or a nearby pickup game of basketball or hangouts. This project can help people who want to get out of their comfort zone find people with common interest. Are your plans ruined by the weather? GoatF, can suggest some good alternatives.
 
Who is the target audience? Who will use your product?
Our target demographic is around the ages of 13 and older. For our younger audience, this would be a good and easy way to invite friends to excursions. Furthermore, our younger audience have the ability to create connections with people who share common interest. As for our older audience, since life is busier due to jobs and obligations, GoatF is a great application to schedule events with other busy friends. All in all, GoatF just wants to help anyone who would like to connect through shared interests
 
Does this project have many individual features, or one main feature (possibility with many problems)? These are the ‘epics’ of your project.
 
The main feature of the app is to create excursions and connect with people with similar interests. One subproblem of this project is using their geographic location to determine weather conditions and to suggest nearby locations for your activity. Another subproblem would be the chat and friend API of the project. By allowing users to chat and friend each other on the app, it’ll help the users connect with one another.
What are some sample stories/scenarios? For example, as a regular user to your site, what types of things can I do? As an admin for your site? These are the ‘stories’ of your project
 
 
As a user, after the registration, you will be able to pick certain dates and receive the weather forecast of the selected dates. You will also see suggested activities and be able to pick from existing events that other users have made or create your own. If the user creates his own, it’ll show popular locations for your selected activities. The users can also message each other privately or create an excursion chat to finalize details.
 
Admins will be able to moderate the users. We will be able to ban or suspend users for harassment or violating the terms and conditions. We will also be able to receive reports about other users and feedback about our app. We will also be able to review the data on user activities, such as the selected location and the activity.
